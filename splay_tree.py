# slapy tree is a binary search tree but everytime you perform an operation on the  tree you should perform
# splay operation
# splay is used to reduce the height of the tree -> no more long backbones
# Zig, Zig-zag, Zig-Zig
# not that great when all nodes accessed same number of times -> if nodes are accessed often splay is good with most accessed at the top
