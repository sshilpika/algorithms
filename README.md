## Algorithms Overview

The worst-case analysis of an algorithm provides the upper bound for the running time of an algorithm.

The average-case analysis of an algorithm is the probabilistic analysis of the average running time of an algorithm.

Asymptotic notation provides a tool to effectively compare the time complexities of different algorithms.
